        <b>REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH</b><br /><br />
        One interpretation of reproductive health, or sexual health 
        implies that men and women ought to be informed of and to have access to safe, effective, affordable and acceptable methods of birth control; also access to appropriate health care services of sexual, reproductive medicine and implementation of health education programs to stress the importance of women to go safely through pregnancy and childbirth. This provides couples with the best chance of having a healthy infants. It is the policy of the Government of Uganda to enhance the reproductive health status of all Ugandans by increasing equitable access to reproductive health services and by improving the quality, efficiency and effectiveness of the services at all levels. <br />
        <b>Mandate:</b><br /> The Reproductive Health division  guides planning, standardization, implementation and monitoring and evaluation of reproductive health services provided by the Government, Non Governmental Organizations (NGOs), faith-based organizations (FBOs), community-based organizations (CBOs), private for-profit sectors and communities in Uganda.

        <b>CHILD HEALTH</b><br /><br />
        The Child Health division is majorly concerned with the health of newborns and children (0 to 5 years and below). Children represent the future, and ensuring their healthy growth and development ought to be a prime concern of all societies. Newborns are particularly vulnerable and children are vulnerable to malnutrition and infectious diseases, many of which can be effectively prevented or treated.<br /><br />
        <b>Mandate:</b><br /><br />
        To promote child and newborn survival, growth and development. To scale-up and sustain high effective coverage of a priority package of cost-effective child, newborn survival and development interventions through three service delivery modes at family-oriented, community-based services, population-oriented, schedulable services and individually-oriented clinical services. The Child Health department also works closely with integrated Community Case Management (iCCM) â€“ part of the Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) strategy, where Village Health Teams (VHTs) offer curative treatments for malaria, diarrhea and pneumonia to children (0-5 years and below) at community level. Village Health Teams (VHTs) are a non-statutory community structure where each village chooses people from their own communities to promote the health and wellbeing of that community. VHT members per village are trained in the VHT basic package, which includes disease prevention, health promotion, health education, community mobilization, and the promotion of good hygiene and sanitation practices. They also distribute condoms, an effort towards improving sexual and reproductive health in these communities as well as medicines.
